# Coffee Quality Prediction Web Application deployed with Docker
This project is a Flask web application that allows users to upload datasets, train regression models (such as Random Forest, SVM, or KNN) on the data, evaluate model performance through percentage split, user-defined test sets, or k-fold cross-validation, compare multiple models, and view the results, with the application being deployed using Docker.
